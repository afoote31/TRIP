# TRIP

This repository contains the code for replicating the analysis and visuals presented in .... This paper is a distillation of my master's thesis, which I completed under the mentorship of Danny Krizanc, with lots of really valuable input from Professor Valerie Nazzaro. The thesis should be under an embargo until May 2026, but hopefully there will be a paper on the internet you can check out! If you don't see anything linked here it probably means that we haven't published anything yet :(. Below is a table with file names and a description of the code that is in each.

| ch3.ipynb | The content of this chapter didn't make it to the paper. I consider the increase in efficiency for the algorithm that results from eliminating repeat computations. Under some assumptions we can get very clean recurrences, which perform decently in practice as estimates. |

| singh.R | The application to the gene expression dataset used in Singh et al. I'm not going to provide the data in this repository, but you should be able to download it for yourself [here](https://www.stats.uwo.ca/faculty/aim/2015/9850/microarrays/FitMArray/data/).|
